A showcase for my personal projects.

I made this repo here because you can't host GitHub IO sites out of anything other than the root of the root directory, so everything but the packaged site will go here.

I will put the site up when it gets closer to something real.

I needed to change something in Samsara (a dependency that is not uploaded in this repo), so I added the changed code file to ImportantExtras
